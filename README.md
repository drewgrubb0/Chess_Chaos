# Chess_Chaos

Hey there,

Thanks for visiting my repository!

This project is a chess engine of sorts based off a Software Engineering class project I had in the Spring of 2018.

**Design a functioning game of Chess from start to finish using the Waterfall Modeling Method that contains:**
- *A Software Requirements Specification (SRS)*
- *A Software Design Document (SDD)*
- *Source Code (src)*
- *A Test Plan (~~Theres no fancy acronym for this~~)*

**The Chess Game must implement some sort of AI, whether imported or handmade:**
- My AI is handmade in the name of learning.

After completing this project, I wanted to come back and revisit it in a personal repository. The goal of this project is to solidify what I learned and to display it for anyone who cares to see it.

***Personal goals for this project***

- Create a v2 of the original project to fulfill the original criteria
- Add a lot of "demo" features and modes to show off the flexibility and scalability of my design
- Implement a replay system
- Add multiple AI

***Demo features possibly included but not limited to***

- Different board or piece types
- "Random" game mode (Pieces are random and placed randomly to begin with)
- AI vs. AI
- Speed Chess

*Note: Demo features will not be included in the SRS and SDD because the design will not be made with them in mind, merely created afterwards as a demonstration.*

***Some general information about this project:***

**Language** - *Java*

**TimeFrame** - *One Month*: March 1st to April 1st - I will do my best to simulate a real working environment where deadlines are very real.

**Graphics Library** - Built using the Java AWT graphics library using listeners for input.

**General Design** - *Game Loop + States* - I like the design concept of update everything and then render it separately, as well as different states for different tasks. The game will be ran at 30 Ticks Per Second
