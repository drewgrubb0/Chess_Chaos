# Chess_Chaos

Hey there,

Thanks for visiting my repository!
Whether you're a potential employer ~~Hire me please~~ or you randomly stumbled upon this project, I'm glad you're here and I hope you enjoy your stay!

This project is based off a Software Engineering class project I had in the Spring of 2018.

The goal of the initial project was simple:

**Design a functioning game of Chess from start to finish using the Waterfall Modeling Method that contains:**
- *A Software Requirements Specification (SRS)*
- *A Software Design Document (SDD)*
- *Source Code (src)*
- *A Test Plan (~~Theres no fancy acronym for this~~)*

**The Chess Game must implement some sort of AI, whether imported or handmade:**
- Spoiler alert, my AI will be handmade in the name of learning.

I was in a group of five people, and needless to say I learned a lot about software design and sequential modeling in general in the five weeks we had on this project.

Although I recieved an A on this project, I wanted to come back and revisit it in a personal repository. The goal of this recreation is to solidify what I learned and to display it for potential employers or anyone who cares to see it. It won't be perfect, but it will be what you could call a literal "good old college try".

In case you are curious, I will be using a solid ***zero percent*** of the code, diagrams, or document text from my class project. Although a majority of that old information [came from me to begin with](https://gyazo.com/add5a42d7b87d7c7d401dd80ecd125c8), I will be building this project from the ground up again completely anew.

***Personal goals for this project***

- Perform the original task assigned
- Add a lot of "demo" features and modes to show off the flexibility and scalability of my design
- Implement a replay system
- Add multiple AI

***Demo features possibly iNcLuDeD bUt NoT lImItEd To***

- Different board or piece types
- "Random" game mode (Pieces are random and placed randomly to begin with)
- AI vs. AI
- Speed Chess

*Note: Demo features will not be included in the SRS and SDD because the design will not be made with them in mind, merely created afterwards as a demonstration.*

***Some general information about this project:***

**Language** - *Java* - (My most experienced language probably, despite most of my coursework being in C++)

**TimeFrame** - *One Month*: March 1st to April 1st - Although it is possible that this project will not be finalized in this time due to a busy schedule or blah blah insert more excuses here blah de blah, I will do my best to simulate a real working environment where deadlines are very real. Whether or not I meet this deadline is of no concern to me, I'll finish the project no matter what.

**Graphics Library** - Built-in *Java AWT using JFrame and Canvas BufferStrategy, with MouseListener and MouseMotionListener* for input.

**General Design** - *Game Loop + States* - I like the design concept of update everything and then render it separately, as well as different states for different tasks. The game will probably run at 30TPS seeing as the only "real time" implementations will be in button hover animations.

**IDE** - *Eclipse* - Because IntelliJ isn't already installed on my computer and who has time for that.

Thanks again for checking out this repository! If you're curious about some of my other work or want to hire me *cough*, be sure to check out some of the links below! Have a nice day!
