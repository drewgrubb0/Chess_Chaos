And version 1.0 of this project has been completed!
It took a little bit longer than anticipated, but it has been completed.

There are a couple areas of the program that could be improved, especially
when it comes to things like Front-End displaying, but the backend was the real
priority for this project.

**Things I hope to do in the future:**
- [ ] Improve/fix the way the game handles certain special moves like En Passant
- [ ] Add pawn promotion
- [ ] Further improve versatility of maps
- [ ] Make better/more AI

For now though, this project is finished. I want to move on to other projects to diversify the portfolio.
